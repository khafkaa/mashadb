## To Do:

1. Inline Documentation
1. Test MashaDB.Table.renumber() without Primary Key
1. Refactor MashaDB.Table.select() to allow spaces in query syntax
1. Refactor to all .method() syntax to conform to single string arguments rather than series of string args.
1. Make distinct a subclass of select, inheriting where and expand.
1. Continue to develop and refine abreviated select syntax
1. Develop 'AND/OR' switch for select statments.
